# SmartTetris
This is an implementation of the classic game Tetris with included bot.

## Requirements
You need PyQt5 version 5.5 or higher.

## How to play?
You can install the game with `python setup.py install` or simply play the game
with `python src/mainscreen.py`.

The game starts with the bot turned off. You can play the game yourself
or turn it on and watch it play. You can also turn off the bot, make a lot of
bad moves and then turn it on again to fix the board or fail trying.

Of course the game has difficulty levels. The higher the level you're on the faster
the pieces fall down.
